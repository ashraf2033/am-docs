# Introduction

UNHCR collaborates with more than 1,000 partners of diverse nature of organisations throughout its operations. The partners include Governmental, Non-Governmental, Community-based Organisations, UN Agencies, academic institutions and other international, and national not-for profit organisations.

Partners are of different organisational nature, governance structure, size, capacity and maturity in managing projects, resources and risks. Management of partnership is multifaceted and involves numerous stakeholders (UNHCR, partners, donors, oversight bodies, persons of concern, etc.). Hence, UNHCR adopted Risk-based Framework for Implementing with Partners.

UNHCR provides funds to its implementing Partner(s), hereafter referred to as Partner(s), for undertaking Project(s) to serve refugees and other persons of concern under a Partnership Agreement (PA), in accordance with the UNHCRâ€™s Risk-based Framework for Implementing with Partners.  The Agreement defines the terms governing the engagement of all parties to the agreement (including obligations, responsibilities, required deliverables, budget, UNHCR financial contribution, etc.).

As part of complementary assurances and risk-based partnership management, UNHCR multifunctional teams in the country of operations conduct a risk assessment of Partner capacity as well as monitoring Partner performance through several modes including monitoring of progress of achievements against plans, spot checks, on-site verifications of delivery, and  reported expenditures incurred to implement the work against budget and reports.

The Implementing Partnership Management Service (IPMS) is designated to lead and oversees UNHCR's efforts to strengthen the strategic UNHCR-funded partnership and operational management, as well as enhance assurance and accountability of implementing partnerships. Most of the partnership management process is conducted off line, and at best using excel sheets, word, emails, etc. There is also no supporting digitalised and streamline system, and work is done in fragmented manner.

In 2015, UNHCR shifted the audit of UNHCR funded projects that are undertaken by its partners into risk-based approach and centralised the management of audit engagement in coordination with field operations. In addition, partners are required to submit periodic and final financial and performance reports on the entrusted resources and expected delivery of services to persons of concern as stipulated under Partnership Agreement. UNHCR field operations monitor the activities conducted by partners, verify their reports and provide support.

All these activities are managed off-line and manual processes resulting into paper works, inefficiency and tedious, raising the need of a streamlined processes based on innovative technology replacing current paper and manually-managed process, and leading to UNHCR objective to digitize the current manual Audit and Reporting Components of the Integrity and Assurance process by developing an **Integrity and Assurance Module** that will  include:

- Audit Management
- Reporting components
- Documentation Management
